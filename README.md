# Exploring Athens AirBnB

This was a project for my Applied Machine Learning course, where I had to analyze data from AirBnB listings in Athens, Greece in the period September 2023-August 2024. I received the data from [Inside AirBnB](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/) at October 19th, and analyzed it until the due date at October 28th.

## Analysis Conducted
This assignment had various tasks to be completed, with no restrictions on the way it had to be done, since there wasn't any correct answer to begin with. The chapters you'll find in the notebook are:
* **Neighbourhood Listings in Descending Order**
* **Neighbourhood Prices in Descending Order**
* **Availability per Day**
* **Reviews, Occupacy per Listing, Average Income**
* **Listings per Room Type**
* **Prices per Day**
* **Listings per Host**
* **Visualize Listings**

## Modules Used
I used various modules for this project, using a **Conda Virtual Environment**. These were:
* **numpy** for some mathematical functions on vectors
* **pandas** for data manipulation, transformation and aggregation, pretty much in the entirety of the project
* **re** to extract patterns from specific columns using regular expressions
* **matplotlib** for visualizations that needed more control
* **seaborn** for faster and pretty visualizations and
* **folium** to create an interactive map with the listings insided the city of Athens
